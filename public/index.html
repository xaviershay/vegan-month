    <section>
      <h1>Why Vegan?</h1>
      <p>There are many reasons to go Vegan, from compassion, to concern for the environment, to health. Many people like the idea of Veganism, but for whatever reason are <strong>stuck</strong> on their current diet. This program will guide you through the <strong>first step</strong> of adopting a Vegan lifestyle. A month is long enough to allow your body to adapt to changes in diet, and your brain to adjust to new habits, but not so long as to seem insurmountable. It's only a month! If it is not working out you can rough it out and if you feel the same way after a month, you can always revert to your previous lifestyle.</p>
      <p>A common misconception is that Veganism is about sacrifice &mdash; cutting out things you used to eat or wear. In fact, it is a <strong>step sideways</strong> into a new way of thinking about how you interact with the world. Far from being a sacrifice, it opens up a whole new abundance of foods, clothing, and mindset. As you would expect, there is a lot of <strong>learning</strong> involved to get started, but once it becomes habit you barely have to think about it anymore. This course is designed to get you through the difficult first month.

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <p>You and a small group (no more than seven) of other cadets from your <strong>local area</strong> all start a Vegan lifestyle on the first day of the month, with the aim to keep that lifestyle for the entire month. You will have the support of your peer group plus an <strong>experienced mentor</strong>, who will provide challenges, assignments, and recipes to help you learn about, experience, and fully immerse yourself in the Vegan lifestyle.</p>
      <p>There is contact throughout the week via email and/or phone, and there is a weekly dinner to catch up with the group, report on progress, and of course just have a good time! This is an <strong>immersive course.</strong></p>

      <h1>Curriculum</h1>
      <p>Alongside continuous mentoring, the course includes a <strong>progressive curriculum</strong> to introduce you to the Vegan lifestyle. This is not a 30 day meal plan though! Discovering your own recipes and foods is part of the learning process, but plenty of guidance is provided for things you might like to try. A broad outline of some of the topics covered:</p>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Vegan basics</li>
        <li>Nutrition research assignment</li>
        <li>Simple dinners</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stir fry variations</li>
        <li>Group market visit</li>
        <li>Team challenge: Potluck!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Philosophy research assignment</li>
        <li>Burritos and wraps</li>
        <li>Breakfast cook up</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Roast</li>
        <li>Team Challenge: Formal dinner</li>

      <p>As well as weekly dinners, suggested recipes, ongoing motivation and support, and some surprises along the way.</p>

      <h1>But I really like cheese!</h1>
      <p>That is why there is a mentor and a peer group, to help you through difficulties like this. I provide plenty of strategies to deal with issues like this, but remember it's only a month! If you really need to eat some cheese at the end of it I'm not going to stop you (there might be a frown though&hellip;)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
      <p>There is no upfront cost, and at the end a full month of mentoring and curriculum you pay what you feel the course was worth to you, by either cash or bank deposit (anonymously if you wish).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
