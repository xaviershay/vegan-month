      <h1>Vegan Month</h1>
      <h2>Explore the Vegan lifestyle for a month, with the support of a mentor and your peers.</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>There are many reasons to go Vegan, from compassion, to concern for the environment to health. Whatever your reason, this program will help you through the first step of adopting a Vegan lifestyle. A month is long enough to allow your body to adapt to changes in diet, and your brain to adjust to new habits, but not so long as to seem insurmountable. It's only a month! If it is not working out you can rough it out and if you feel the same way after a month, you can always revert to your previous lifestyle.</p>
      <p>A common misconception is that Veganism is about sacrifice &mdash; cutting out things you used to eat or wear. In fact, it is a step sideways into a new way of thinking about how you interact with the world. Far from being a sacrifice, it opens up a whole new abundance of foods, clothing, and mindset. As you'd expect, there is a lot of learning involved to get started, but once it becomes habit you barely have to think about it anymore. This course is designed to get you through the difficult first month.

    <section>
      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <p>You and a small group (less than ten) of other cadets from your local area all start a Vegan lifestyle on the first day of the month, with the aim to keep that lifestyle for the entire month. You will have the support of your peer group plus an experienced mentor (that's me), who will provide challenges, assignments, and recipes to help you learn about, experience, and fully immerse yourself in the Vegan lifestyle. There is a weekly dinner to catch up with the group, report on progress, and of course just have a good time!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
      <p>I am running the first pilot program in Melbourne starting November 2010. This is heavily discounted at only $75, and places are strictly limited. The catch being I have some extra feedback surveys I will ask you to fill out during the course to help me refine the course.
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Where?</h1>
      <p>For the pilot program, you have to be in Melbourne, Australia. After that, I will be teaming up with mentors in other cities to offer the program all over the place, so email me and get yourself on a mailing list.</p>

    <section>
      <h1>But I really like cheese!</h1>
      <p>That's why there's a mentor and a peer group, to help you through difficulties like this. I provide plenty of strategies to deal with issues like this, but remember it's only a month! If you really need to eat some cheese at the end of it I'm not going to stop you (there might be a frown though&hellip;)</p>
